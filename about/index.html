In the first decade of the 21st century, natural disasters affected the lives of over two billion 

people—more than a quarter of the world’s population.  The impact of these disasters set the 

global economy back by nearly US$1 trillion. 

In recent years public and private sector actors have started numerous partnership with the tech 

community to spur civic engagement and collaboratively develop software or hardware tools that 

can improve communities’ resilience to natural disasters. These initiatives often use open data sets 

and open source software to link stakeholders and provide the tools to collect, analyze, share, and 

improve risk data for better decision-making.  

Code for Resilience (CfR), a multi year project of the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster 

Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) in collaboration with wide ranging global partners from the public, 

private, community, and the civic tech field aims at building communities’ resilience to natural 

disasters through innovative uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs).

 

Through a series of virtual and in-person activities, Code For Resilience focuses on creating locally 

relevant software and hardware tools that address disaster risk management (DRM) challenges. The 

resulting “civic technologies”—or ICT-based tools built by, with, and for local communities—will 

help improve communities’ ability to identify and reduce natural disaster risks, and to better 

prepare for and respond to major natural disasters.

Code for Resilience is organized into the following phases:

1.     Problem Statement Definitions: Code for Resilience draws on the experience and needs of the 

public sector, private sector, World Bank, the public and other international partners to generate a 

list of DRM challenges. Problem statements from the ex ante portion of the DRM cycle (risk 

assessment & identification, risk reduction, and preparedness) are prioritized.

2.     Participants trainings: CfR leverages our global partners’ expertise and existing programs to 

provide tailored training opportunities for participants on the use of open source tools and open 

data for DRM that address the problem statements. 

3.     Code sprints:  Once the problem statements are clearly defined, end user and stakeholder buy-

in is secured, and relevant training are provided, selected participants gather to carry out Code 

Sprints that continue for 48-72 hours to develop a prototype solution. These solutions can range 

from mobile, geospatial, gamification, to data, social, and hardware tools that provide innovative 

DRM solutions. Teams that participate in these code sprints often consist of software developers, 

project managers, user interface developers, and designers. 

4.     Post Code Sprint Challenges: Following the code sprints, participants will continue to develop 

their tools. During this time, participants will have the opportunity to work and receive expert 

advice from CfR partners and experts in the fields of DRM, business, and ICT to further develop, 

test, and refine their apps, to turn them into minimum viable products (MVPs). 

5.    Evaluation and Review: Participants and partners will have the opportunity to provide feedback 

on the program and processes to improve program delivery.

 

In 2014, over 1,000 developers participated in 11 Code for Resilience events in nine countries: 

Bangladesh, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, the Philippines, the United States, and Vietnam. 

Planning of events for 2015 are underway, with the first event focusing on the East African region in 

April/May 2015.
