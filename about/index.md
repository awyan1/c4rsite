About Code for Resilience
=========================

In the first decade of the 21st century, natural disasters affected the lives of over two billion people—more than a quarter of the world’s population. The impact of these disasters disproportionally affected vulnerable communities, and together set the global economy back by nearly US$1 trillion.
 
Code for Resilience strengthens the resilience of at-risk communities to natural disasters through innovative uses of information and communication technologies. Through trainings, code sprints, and fellowships, Code for Resilience works in partnership with local actors to build capacity and refine tools that improve local disaster risk management.

Launched in 2014, Code for Resilience is a multi-year project of the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. In its first year, Code for Resilience engaged over 1,000 technologists across eleven code sprint events in eight countries. In 2015 Code for Resilience is increasing its focus on building the capacity of individuals trained in both technology and disaster risk management through the introduction of the Code for Resilience fellowship program.

Activities
==========

Code for Resilience identifies country partners that are willing to commit financial and technical resources to co-invest in developing capacity, community, and tools that leverage innovations in technology to strengthen community resilience to natural disasters. Where Code for Resilience offers:

* Identifying Problem Statement: Code for Resilience draws on the experience and needs of the public sector, private sector, the World Bank Group, the public, and other international partners to generate a list of challenges related to disaster risk assessment and identification, disaster risk reduction, and disaster preparedness.
 
* Building Capacity: Code for Resilience complements its partners’ existing programs and expertise by providing tailored training as needed on the use of open source tools and open data to address disaster risk management problem statements. 

* Coding for Resilience:  Once problem statements are clearly identified, if a review identifies that existing tools must be adapted to meet local needs, Code for Resilience will provide financial and technical support to organize code sprints in collaboration with local partners. Code sprints typically are held over two to three days to tailor existing solutions or, if necessary, prototype a new solution. 

* Investing in Expertise: Code for Resilience fellows are selected through these activities to refine technology-based solutions to local disaster risk management challenges. During a period of at least three months, fellows receive financial and technical support to further develop, test, and refine solutions in collaboration with local partners. 
 
* Evaluating Delivery Against Problem Statement: To inform future efforts, partners and participants are asked to provide feedback on the process and outputs. Evaluations are carried after each code sprint, and additional feedback is welcomed throughout the Code for Resilience engagement.
