About Code for Resilience
=========================

In the first decade of the 21st century, natural disasters affected the lives of over two billion people—more than a quarter of the world’s population. The impact of these disasters set the global economy back by nearly US$1 trillion.
 
Code for Resilience, a multi-year project of the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) in collaboration with wide ranging global partners from the public, private, community, and the civic tech field aims to strengthen communities’ resilience to natural disasters through innovative uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs).
 
Through a series of virtual and in-person activities, Code For Resilience focuses on creating locally relevant software and hardware tools that address disaster risk management challenges. The resulting “civic technologies”—or ICT-based tools built by, with, and for local communities—are designed to improve communities’ ability to identify and reduce natural disaster risks, and to better prepare for and respond to major natural disasters.

Activities
==========

Since 2014 Code for Resilience has connected civil society, governments, and technologists through events, mentorship, and code sprint activities. In 2014 Code for Resilience engaged over 1,000 technologists in eleven code sprint events across eight countries. In 2015 Code for Resilience is increasing its focus on building the capacity of individuals trained in both technology and disaster risk management through the introduction of the Code for Resilience fellowship program. 

Specifically, the program is organized into the following phases:
 
1.  Problem Statement Definitions: Code for Resilience draws on the experience and needs of the public sector, private sector, the World Bank Group, the public and other international partners to generate a list of DRM challenges. Problem statements from the ex ante portion of the DRM cycle (risk assessment & identification, risk reduction, and preparedness) are prioritized.
 
2.  Participants trainings: CfR leverages our global partners’ expertise and existing programs to provide tailored training opportunities for participants, as needed, on the use of open source tools and open data for DRM that address the problem statements. 

3.  Code sprints:  Once the problem statements are clearly defined, end user and stakeholder buy-in is secured, and relevant training are provided, selected participants gather to carry out Code Sprints that continue for 48-72 hours to develop a prototype solution. These solutions can range from mobile, geospatial, gamification, to data, social, and hardware tools that provide innovative DRM solutions. Teams that participate in these code sprints often consist of software developers, project managers, user interface developers, and designers.
Check our Project Locations to see if CfR is coming to your town and to participate in the next Code Sprint. 

4.  CfR Fellowship Program: Following the code sprints, selected participants will continue to develop the prototype solution for a period of at least three months through CfR Fellowship program. During this time, participants will have the opportunity to work and receive expert advice from CfR partners and experts in the fields of DRM, business, and ICT to further develop, test, and refine their apps, to turn them into minimum viable products (MVPs).
 
5.  Evaluation and Review: Participants and partners will have the opportunity to provide feedback on the program and processes to improve program delivery.
Evaluations are carried out after each event, but if you have participated in any of our events and would like to provide direct additional feedback or stay in touch, please contact us.
