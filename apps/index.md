[SMS Lapli](http://github.com/gfdrr/sms-lapli) means “SMS Rain” in Haitian Creole, will help the newly created Hydromet Unit at the Ministry of Agriculture to systematically collect, analyze, archive and disseminate rainfall data from more than 100 agro-meteorological stations across the country. This open source application is just the first module of a national data platform allowing different hydromet networks in the country to work together.
